# Internet-speed-twitter-customer-service-
This script uses Selenium to check internet speed on Speedtest.net and tweet a complaint if the speed is below the promised rate. It logs into Twitter, posts a message with the current and expected speeds, and quits. Code is organized in a class for clarity. Some syntax errors (e.g., typos, imports) need fixing.
